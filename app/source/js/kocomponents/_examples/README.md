# Knockout Components Examples
Each contained folder is an example of a component that can be inspected to look
for help about how to create components and used as a base template that can
be copied+renamed to implement a new one.

*Note:* let's name this 'examples' rather than 'templates' to do not confuse
with the html templates used by the components.

## Learning
If is your first time here, please read carefull this README and take a look
to the examples following the alphabetic order of their names; you will see
that an initial letter is being used to sort them, starting from the most simple
and adding details based on concepts learnt in previous examples.

## Naming
Remember that each new component must go in a folder that groups
a set of components (a *package*, related by the app feature they implements or
a kind of shared utilities), the name of that folder is used as the prefix
for the components tag name, and must use hyphens and lowercase.

The subfolder with the component definition must not have the prefix.

When copying an example to create a new component, remember set the name
properly in the folders and in the code replace every
occurrence of texts 'ComponentExample' or 'component-example' with your
component name matching the casing.

## Inline notes
The examples has some notes like 'FIXME:' that need to be read carefully and
removed. Please, follow the instructions on each of them, specially 'FIXME:',
the ones that say 'REMOVEME:' are just highlighted notes that should be removed.
