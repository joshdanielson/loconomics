/**
    New Function method: '_delayed'.
    It returns a new function, wrapping the original one,
    that once its call will delay the execution the given milliseconds,
    using a setTimeout.
    The new function returns 'undefined' since it has not the result,
    because of that is only suitable with return-free functions 
    like event handlers.
    
    Why: sometimes, the handler for an event needs to be executed
    after a delay instead of instantly.
