## [Comparison Table of WCAG 2.0 to Existing Section 508 Standards](https://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/communications-and-it/about-the-ict-refresh/background/comparison-table-of-wcag2-to-existing-508-standards)
There are 38 Level A and AA Success Criteria.  Of these, 22 are phrased differently but equivalent in substance to current 508 requirements.  Content that meets the current 508 requirements would not have to be changed to meet the corresponding success criteria.  Sixteen success criteria are new and content that meets the current 508 requirements might not meet these success criteria.
